Program Description:

My program will generate and read a text in which instances of games are declared.
Each line in this file will denote either a game that can be bought or a game that can be rented.
Each line will contain this information separated by commas ",": Game Name, Category, Memory, Price, Discount.
The programm will determinate wether the game is a game that can be bought or a game that can be rented.
After that, it will add each game in a dictionary where it will order it by the new price after discount is applied.

Code Descritpion:

GameShop.py:

A parent class named GameShop is created to store values: Name, Category, Memory and Price
Each of these properties of class have their respective getters and setters.
Also an abstarct method getNewPrice is created and will be overriden by the inherited classes.

We will have two classes inheriting from GameShop. Buy and RenIt.
The main difference between them is discount poperty.
On a game that can be bought the discount is not applied and it will be calculated as 0, which is different from RentIt property.
For a game that can be bought it's price is calculated differently from a game that can be rented.


main.py

The programm will make use of some pre defined objects:
A string for the name of text file.
A list to use for each line inside the text file.
A couple of dictionaries to append each object taken from the file.
Some integers for newline, list and dictionaries element counters.

A file is created then wrriten on ti by the function gameGenerator.
I have defined this function for the purpose to generate each game instance.
gameGenerator will take a number, which will be used as the name of the game and category: Game n, Category n
I have used the random python library to determine the numbers of each game.

After that we open the file again but this time instead of write we will read from the file.
I have used a for loop to appen each line on the file into a list name "all_lines"

Then we create a pattern recognition (regex) formulla which will:
-separate each line by its commas
-create objects based on the information in file
- append these objects to our pre-defined dictionaries.

Then, I have created 3 methods:
-"getPrices": which will execute the getNewPrice method on each property instance and assert it in a dictionary.
-"findHighestPrice": which will sort prices and show the highest game price
-"findLowestPrice": which will sort prices and show the lowest game price

and we will open again the file to read all lines and we have created a list to append all lines in our file sort them based on the price from lowest to highest
and print the list.
